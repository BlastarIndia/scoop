-------------------------------------

Scoop (which stands for "Scoop Is Not A Recursive Acronym", by the way) started
out as an improved replacement for the Slash weblog system.  It has since grown
into a fairly full-featured content management/discussion engine.

This tarball will function as a CVS checkout (as it is literally a tarball of
exactly that).  If it's much past the date above, try doing:

$ cvs update

from within the top scoop/ directory to get the freshest code, or run the
get-scoop.sh script provided.  It will create a scoop/ directory in the current
working directory and grab the CVS code.  Please note that it requires you have
both the CVS utilities and SSH installed and available.

To Install
----------

Read the Installation section of the Scoop Administrators Guide (it's in the
doc/scoop_admin_guide/ directory).

Lots more info and support is available at http://scoop.kuro5hin.org/.  We also
hang out in #scoop on irc.slashnet.org.

Good luck!
