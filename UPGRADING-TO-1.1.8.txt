If you're upgrading a version of Scoop < 1.1.8, be aware that some XSS vulnerabilities were fixed in that release, and when you upgrade, you need to fix these boxes that are known to have vulnerabilities by hand:

comment_controls
addtag
tag_listing

For comment_controls, add these lines right below where $sid, $cid, $pid, and $qid are defined:

$sid = $S->filter_param($sid);
$pid = $S->filter_param($pid);
$cid = $S->filter_param($cid);
$qid = $S->filter_param($qid);

Add them below these lines:
my $sid = $S->{CGI}->param('sid');
my $pid = $S->{CGI}->param('pid');
my $cid = $S->{CGI}->param('cid');
my $qid = $S->{CGI}->param('qid');

For addtag and tag_listing, add this line:
$sid = $S->filter_param($sid);

below this one:
my $sid = $S->cgi->param('sid');
