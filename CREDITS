While the current state of the tables differs slightly, in some cases
significantly, some table formats were inspired by slash 0.3, by Rob Malda
(and many others).

Thanks also to slashdot for inspiration and concepts, and for providing us with
a motivation to write a system that isn't as bloated as theirs ;-)

Many thanks to Brent Metzler for running scoop.kuro5hin.org and stepping up to
maintain the open source project.  Check out http://www.geeky.org/ :-)

Thanks to John Havard, Head Geek at The Seven Sages Project
(http://www.sevensages.org/) for suggesting the user creation scheme, and
assuring me it would prevent story spamming.  If it doesn't work, blame him. ;-)
And thanks to John also for fixing my fscked-up zone file.

Dylan Griffiths <Inoshiro@kuro5hin.org> suggested a great many features, found
some bugs, has helped keep me sane, and introduce me to Slackware.  He also is
responsible for some of the documentation, as well as attempting to improve
the commenting within the code itself.

Karsten Self <kmself@ix.netcom.com> provided a great lot of feedback and ideas, 
and pretty much designed the comment rating system.  He has also gone way out
of his way to promote Scoop everywhere.

Chris Ainsworth has done heaps of graphics work for free, and deserves a big
hand.

Eveyone else at http://www.kuro5hin.org/ has also been a huge help in ferreting 
out bugs and "features" and in making this as "stable" as it is now, and for 
continuing to give me a standard to live up to.

And thanks to everyone on slashdot.org, technocrat.net, and advogato.org who
gave us good ideas and plans for the future.
