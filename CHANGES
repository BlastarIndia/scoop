Scoop 1.1 -> 1.2
not released yet
----------------
Features:
* You can now use radio buttons instead of the drop-down box to rate comments
* You can now use memcached instead of the built-in Scoop caching system to
  cache objects. This has a variety of advantages.
* Support for master/slave database setups

Bug fixes:
* Display bug in dynamic comments where $text was displayed instead of the
  value being interpolated
* Login form posts to current page so you stay where you are
* Boxtool stamps the block cache properly now, so changes take effect immediately
* Boxtool theoretically works with postgres. Takes a -d option if you want to
  try it, otherwise defaults to mysql.
* XSS security fixes (in 1.1.8).

Scoop 1.0 -> 1.1
released 02/08/2006
----------------
Features:
* Polls optionally allow approval voting (users can make multiple selections)
* Scoop now integrates its own session module instead of requiring
  Apache::Session
* Added flexible and admin-configurable user preferences
* Added collaborative event calendar module
* Comment "remove" in addition to the existing "delete". ("Remove" replaces
  the comment with some text indicating that it's been deleted, while "delete"
  makes the comment disappear entirely.)
* Added favicon.ico and robots.txt with decent defaults.
* Dropped ForumZilla support.
* You can now restrict where macros are run in the same way as you restrict 
  HTML tag use - by location and user group.
* You can have custom submission/post messages per section. Submission messages
  are for when the story goes to the queue, post messages are for when it's
  auto-posted (via section perms).
* Tag categorization: on story submission, the author can specify a series of
  keywords to use for filing their story. Stories can be browsed by tag in
  addition to (or instead of) the traditional sections and topics.
* Special pages can now be optionally accessed directly by |rootdir|/pageid
  instead of via |rootdir|/special/pageid (subject to the pageid not being an
  existing scoop op)
* Shared database support
* Changes in new user signups, where they can set their own initial password
  and receive a confirmation link.

Bug Fixes:
* HTML removal:
  * Comment post form
  * User/Interface/Comment preference forms
  * Special pages format
  * Special pages admin tool
* Fixed DB quoting, date format, and other things that were MySQL-specific
* Special key parsing can now handle commas inside quoted (single or double)
  arguments, and spaces after commas between arguments
* Removed use_diaries, use section permissions instead
* Updated Bundle::Scoop to reflect Scoop's current dependencies
* Fixed a bug in the startpage_validation box
* Fixed the minimal preview bug - now you can see what your comment will look
  like if you use minimal mode
* Fixed a precedence bug in boxtool so it actually pays attention to your
  $EDITOR environment variable instead of always using vi.
