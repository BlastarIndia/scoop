This just lists the order that you need to apply these patches, and the dates
on which they were added to scoop. 

The upgrade-db.pl in scripts/ will (hopefully) do all this for you. Try running
it first.

Apply them to your database in the order below with
mysql -u root -p <scoopdb> < patch-NN-Name.sql

Run the scripts with 
./script-NN-(pre|post).pl

If there are scripts and patches with the same number, run the -pre script
first, then apply the patch, then run the -post script

Don't apply patches dated earlier than when you installed scoop, or when you
created the scoop database with scoop.sql  These patches are all in the
scoop.sql file already
