This just lists the order that you need to apply these patches, and the dates
on which they were added to scoop. 

The upgrade-db.pl in scripts/ will (hopefully) do all this for you. Try running
it first.

Apply them to your database in the order below with
mysql -u root -p <scoopdb> < patch-NN-Name.sql

Run the scripts with 
./script-NN-(pre|post).pl

If there are scripts and patches with the same number, run the -pre script
first, then apply the patch, then run the -post script

Don't apply patches dated earlier than when you installed scoop, or when you
created the scoop database with scoop.sql  These patches are all in the
scoop.sql file already


Jul  2 13:32 patch-01-MultiPolls.sql
	Allows "approval voting" in polls as an option.

Jul  6 01:44 patch-02-Sessions.sql
	Drops and re-creates the sessions table to be compatible with the new
	Scoop::Sessions module.

Jul 18 12:15 patch-03-CommentPost.sql
	Moves the comment post form to a block

Aug 4 14:17 patch-04-UserPrefs.sql

	Bugfixes and small feature additions for the above userprefs patch.

Aug 27 13:30 patch-06-UserPrefs3.sql
	More bugfixes: fixed a caching issue and added the ability to use a box
	for validation instead of a regex, if desired. If you want both, put
	the regex in the box.

Jan 15 9:50 patch-07-SpecialPage.sql
	Moves the special page formatting to a block

Jan 21 09:30 patch-08-Calendar.sql
        Adds a very featureful collaborative event calendar module. Docs remain to
        be written, unfortunately, but here's all the funtionality, anyway.

Jan 22 19:20 patch-09-Diary.sql
	Removes the use_diaries var and uses the section perms instead.

Jan 25 10:10 patch-10-CalendarUpdates.sql
        Updates and bugfixes to the Calendar module. Adds a separate calendar_css
        block, and a css_includes block, which should be called in place of the
        existing css LINK REL in your templates. Makes keeping CSS up to date much
        easier.

Jan 25 12:11 patch-11-SignupWithPass.sql
        Mainly adds a new signup method where the user chooses their own password.
        Works a lot more smoothly than the old way. If you install fresh, it's the default.
        If not, you need to edit a bunch of Accounts blocks and turn on 
        "signup_with_password" var. This patch also adds CT's iplookup tools, and
        flexible date formatting.

Jan 27 11:30 patch-12-RemoveComments.sql
	Adds the ability to "remove" (in addition to the old "delete") comments. 
	"Remove" replaces the comment with a note saying the comment had been deleted, 
	but doesn't change the comment threading.

Jan 27 2:42 patch-13-RemoveForumZilla.sql
	Drops the boxes, blocks, and ops that support ForumZilla.

Jan 28 3:57 patch-14-PostThrottle.sql
        Bugfix for problems in the post throttling code, moves content out of code.

Feb 03 10:36 patch-15-StoryForm.sql
        Moves story posting forms entirely into blocks. This will make it a lot
        easier to add extra fields or customizations to stories. Also, there's 
        a new admin_tools box that handles a change in admin tools to allow for 
        more than one perm per tool. Updated here as admin_tools_new to not clobber 
        custom boxes.

Feb 11 2:00 patch-16-MacroPerms.sql
	Adds the ability to restrict macros by location and user group, using the same 
	syntax as the allowed_html block. The script fixes a small bug in one of the 
	userpref boxes.

May 26 10:30 patch-17-NavBar.sql
	Moves the story nav bar from hard coded HTML into blocks.

May 26 11:25 patch-18-EditoralComment.sql
	Fixes comment type toggling in edit queue stories.

May 26 12:05 patch-19-StoryVoteMessage.sql
	Move the story vote messages from code into blocks.

May 27 6:45 patch-20-StoryPosting.sql
	Updates the story post messages and the story post form action

Sep 9 4:30 patch-21-Tags.sql
	Adds tag categorization.

Oct 6 1:25 patch-22-SharedDB.sql
	Adds shared database support.

Oct 14 13:08 patch-23-MinMax.sql
			 patch-24-CommentFixes.sql
			 patch-25-UserFile.sql
			 patch-26-UserMenu.sql
	A bunch of patches being checked in at the same time here. 
	Patch 23 has some fixes for min/max characters in a story's intro and fixes
	for blank titles.
	Patch 24 has miscellaneous comment fixes.
	Patch 25 adds some permissions to eliminate file permission quirks.
	Patch 26 adds a copy of the userpref menu that fixes the file permission
	quirks and fixes the issue where the user pref menu would display pref
	pages on the menu that exist even if the user can't view or modify any of
	those prefs.  Because modifying an exisiting userpref_menu is bad, this
	adds a box called 'userpref_menu_file_pref' with these fixes. From this
	box, site administrators can add the fixes to their existing userpref_menu
	boxes without destroying the existing box.

Dec 17 21:00 patch-27-SpecialAdmin.sql
	Moves the special pages admin form to a block and adds the ability to see
	special pages as if the pageid were an op.

Jan 13 2006 13:38 patch-28-RequireTags.sql
	Adds a var to enable requiring tags for story posting.

Jan 13 15:50 patch-29-TUPerms.sql
	Adds a var to add perms that can be specifically checked by
	$S->have_perm() for trusted users, so we can use just that var and
	$S->have_perm, rather than mucking about with TRUSTLEV and super_mojo.

Jan 15 11:20 patch-30-TagEnhancements.sql
	Adds ops, boxes, and perms for adding and editing existing story tags,
	as well as an op for easily changing the order tags are displayed. If
	you upgrade to this, it is recommended that you make a "tag_template"
	block for the tag op from the index_template and add the 
	"tag_sort_change" box above |CONTENT|. Additionally, you should add the
	"tag_listing" box to your story_template - above the first
	"comment_controls" box is a good place.

Jan 15 14:53 patch-31-TagPermUpdate.sql
	Adds a perm, 'edit_story_tags', that was left out of patch 30. If you
	wish to allow trusted users, but not others, edit story tags, add
	'edit_story_tags' to the var 'tu_perms'.

Feb 7 20:36 patch-32-DiaryGuidelines.sql
	Adds a block 'diary_guidelines' where different guidelines can be
	given for a diary on a site.
