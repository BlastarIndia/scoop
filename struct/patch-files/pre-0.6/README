Patch numbering and tracking did not start until after the 0.6 release; this
file is an attempt to help those who still have pre-0.6 sites upgrade properly.

Missing patches from this directory can have strange and often disastrous
effects when running other patches in later version directories. One frequently
seen example is losing all ops, which renders the site completely
non-functional.

Since the patches do not have any application order information or tracking,
you will have to check the list below against your database to see which ones
have been applied already and which you still need to apply. The patches are
listed in the order in which they were added to CVS; applying them in this
order should work, starting with the patch after the last one you already have.

Descriptions of visible features have been added to some of the patches to help
you find the patch you want to start with.

Some of the patches have been modified after their creation date (usually small
bugfixes, and usually quite soon after their creation) so you may want to
compare the ones with dates close before your VERSION timestamp to your
database to see if you need to apply them, or parts of them, too.
