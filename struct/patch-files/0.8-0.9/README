This just lists the order that you need to apply these patches, and the dates
on which they were added to scoop. 

The upgrade-db.pl in scripts/ will (hopefully) do all this for you. Try running
it first.

Apply them to your database in the order below with
mysql -u root -p <scoopdb> < patch-NN-Name.sql

Run the scripts with 
./script-NN-(pre|post).pl

If there are scripts and patches with the same number, run the -pre script
first, then apply the patch, then run the -post script

Don't apply patches dated earlier than when you installed scoop, or when you
created the scoop database with scoop.sql  These patches are all in the
scoop.sql file already



Sep 18 0414 patch-01-StaticPageCache.sql
	Apply this, and also create a directory which is read/write for your apache

	INSTALL file for more on the spellchecker

Oct 24 16:49 patch-04-AdPatch1.sql

Nov 15 00:45 patch-05-WipeRatings.sql
	Adds one var that will let you designate a group to change users to if
	the "undo ratings" function is used on them,
    IMPORTANT: For rating undo to work right, you need to edit the block
	"op_templates". Look for the bit like:
     	} else {
			$p->{op}      = 'user';
			$p->{tool}    = $path[1];
 			$p->{nick}    = $path[0];

	notify your users of the change, so they can reset them.

Dec 21 11:12 patch-08-AdPatch2.sql
	The second ad patch.  Big patch. Should apply clean, now you may safely
	start testing the text ads.  Be sure to create a link to /submitad to let

	admin_tools box if you want to admin ads easily.

 		} else {
	To:
 			$p->{type}    = 'author'
 		} elsif ($path[1] eq 'ads' ) {
 			$p->{op}      = 'adinfo';
 			$p->{ad_id}   = "uid:$uid";
		} else {
