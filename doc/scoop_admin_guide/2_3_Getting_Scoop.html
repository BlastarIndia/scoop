</H2>

<P>
Before you can start installing and using Scoop, you're going to need to get it. Of course, if you already have it, then you can probably skip this section. Note that, while you'd usually want to get a stable version of any program, the nature of development with Scoop (at least, currently) results in a lot of new features being in the CVS development version, which is almost always stable. You'll probably want to get the development version.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00023100000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Getting a Tarball</A>
</H3>

<P>
Probably the easiest way to get Scoop is to download a tarball from the development site at <A HREF="http://scoop.kuro5hin.org/">http://scoop.kuro5hin.org/</A>. You'll be able to get the current stable, numbered Scoop release from there, or one built nightly from CVS. You'll also find instructions for using CVS.

<P>
Once you've downloaded Scoop, you'll want to decompress it. Copy the tarball to someplace where Apache can read it (such as ``/usr/local/apache/''), though not in the document root (such as under ``htdocs/'') because you don't want people downloading the code through your website. Decompress it (``tar zxf &lt;filename&gt;''), which will create a new directory called ``scoop''. You can then remove the tarball, or move it somewhere else.

<P>
You do not need to have the code unpacked in the same location as you are using as the documentroot for your Scoop site; however, the directory you are using as a documentroot must exist, even if nothing is in it.  

<P>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Getting From CVS</A>
</H3>

<P>
To checkout manually, first make sure you have the ``cvs'' program, which you can get from <A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/downloads.html">http://www.cvshome.org/downloads.html</A>. After that, switch to a directory where Apache can read (such as ``/usr/local/apache/''), though not in the document root (such as under ``htdocs/''). Then issue the following commands:

<P>
<PRE>
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@scoop.versionhost.com:/cvs/scoop login
password: anonymous
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@scoop.versionhost.com:/cvs/scoop co scoop
</PRE>

<P>
This will appear to do nothing for awhile, then several lines will scroll by. When it finishes, you'll have a new directory called ``scoop'', which is the same as the one you get from downloading a tarball.

<P>
When you're using the CVS version, you should keep up with the latest features and bug fixes.  See section&nbsp;<A HREF="2_6_Upgrading_Scoop.html#upgrading-code">2.6.2</A> for details.
