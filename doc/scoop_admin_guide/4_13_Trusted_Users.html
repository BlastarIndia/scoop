<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">13</SPAN> Trusted Users and Mojo
</H2>

<P>
``Mojo'' is the system Scoop uses to give or take certain <B>comment-related privileges</B>.  A user's mojo is not shown; the only way they can know approximately what it is is by whether or not they have those privileges--assuming they know what the mojo level required for the privileges is.  A user's mojo is always a number in the range of possible comment ratings, set by the variables <B>rating_max</B> and <B>rating_min</B>.  The perm <B>super_mojo</B> (<A HREF="A_12_Groups.html#perm-super-mojo">A.12.52</A>) overrides the mojo calculations and gives a user all the privileges gained by having high mojo.

<P>
Users with mojo higher than the number in the variable <B>mojo_rating_trusted</B> are known as ``trusted users'', and uses with mojo lower than the number in the variable <B>rating_min</B> are known as ``untrusted users''.  Users with mojo between these two numbers have no special name, they're just normal users.  

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Trusted users</B> have the ability to see and rate comments one point below the minimum rating set in <B>rating_min</B>.  
</LI>
<LI><B>Untrusted users</B> post with an initial rating matching their mojo; since by definition their mojo is below <B>rating_min</B>, only trusted users can see their comments.  If a trusted user then rates the comment, the initial rating is overridden and the comment is either hidden or not, depending on the rating.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Mojo is a <B>time-weighted average of a user's comment ratings</B>, so a user must continually maintain his mojo level to remain trusted (or untrusted).  Scoop fetches the user's most recent rated comments, limited by both number and date as set in the variables <B>mojo_max_comments</B> and <B>mojo_max_days</B>, respectively.  If the variable <B>mojo_ignore_diaries</B> is set, comments posted in a diary do not count towards either mojo or the maximum number of comments fetched.

<P>
Comments used in mojo calculations are weighted, with the most recent comments counting for the most; the most recent rated comment is given a weight equal to <B>mojo_max_comments</B>, the second most recent is given a weight equal to mojo_max_comments - 1, and so on down until the last fetched comment.  Both the number of ratings and the value of those ratings are multiplied by the weighting factor.  

<P>
The weighted number of ratings and the sum of the weighted rating values are added independantly, then the value is divided by the number of ratings, to give the user's mojo.

<P>
A user's trusted or untrusted status does not take effect unless the number of rated comments posted in the time limit set in the variable <B>mojo_max_days</B> is greater than the number in the variable <B>mojo_min_trusted</B> for trusted status, or <B>mojo_min_untrusted</B> for untrusted status.

<P>
If user abuses his privileges and <B>rates good comments down or bad comments up</B> in a consistent pattern, his ratings can be reversed and rating privileges taken away with one click by the admin from the user's ``show user ratings'' page.  The group the abusive user is transferred to is named in the variable <B>rating_wipe_group</B>.  This group must exist and shouldn't have the perm <B>comment_rate</B> (<A HREF="A_12_Groups.html#perm-comment-rate">A.12.9</A>).  This doesn't affect that user's mojo calculation, but all users whose comments had been rated have their mojo recalculated.
