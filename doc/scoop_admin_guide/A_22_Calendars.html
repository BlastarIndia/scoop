</H2>

<P>
The calendars admin tool is where you can manage all calendars (<A HREF="4_17_Calendar.html#features-calendar">4.17</A>), events, and define which fields are used for the event form.

<P>
There are three tools on this admin page: Calendar List, Event List, and Event Properties. The calendar list contains links to the edit form for every calendar in the system, and allows you to create additional site-wide calendars (those without an owner). The event list contains links to the edit form for every event in the system, much as the story list and poll list do for their respective features. The event properties allows you to define the fields Scoop will use to collect information about events.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000622100000000000000">
A..<SPAN CLASS="arabic">22</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Calendar List</A>
</H3>

<P>
This is a basic list of calendars, with three columns: the calendar title (linked to the calendar), the calendar owner, and the admin actions available (delete and edit). Site-wide calendars have no owner, and only admins with the <B>edit_calendars</B> perm (<A HREF="A_12_Groups.html#perm-edit-calendars">A.12.15</A>) can edit them. User calendars can also be edited by their owners.

<P>
Below the list is a form with which site-wide calendars can be created. There are only three fields: a title and two permissions fields. A fourth field, for the description, is available on the calendar edit form (<A HREF="#admin-tools-calendars-edit-form">A.22.4</A>). The two permission fields determine who can see the calendar and the events contained in it, and who can submit events to the calendar.

<P>

<BR>
A..<SPAN CLASS="arabic">22</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Event List
</H3>

<P>
The event list is a three-column list which summarizes all events in the system.

<P>
The first column contains the event title, linked to the event page, with an edit link if the current user can edit that event; the second column contains the nickname of the user who submitted the event; the third column contains a list of calendars the event is displayed in, linked to the calendar, with an edit link if the current user can edit that calendar and the name of the calendar owner if it's a user calendar. One calendar in the list will have an asterisk next to it; this indicates the calendar the event takes its permissions from (its `primary' calendar).

<P>
The event submission and editing form is built based on the event properties defined here. Like most admin tools forms, it starts with `Get' and `Save' buttons and a selectbox to choose which item to edit.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Property ID</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The internal name of the event field.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Title</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The display title for the event field.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Format on event page</STRONG></DT>
<DD>On the single event information page, this is the HTML used to format whatever value a user enters into this field when submitting an event. If left blank, the value is displayed as-is. If anything is entered, |value| is replaced with the value entered by the user, and |eid| by the event's ID.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Format in calendar view</STRONG></DT>
<DD>As above, but used in the monthly, weekly, or daily calendar view.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Enabled</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This checkbox determines whether or not the event field is used. This is a global toggle.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Required</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This checkbox determines whether or not the event field must be filled in when an event is submitted or edited.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>HTML allowed</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This checkbox determines whether or not the value entered by the user is filtered through the HTML filter. If HTML is permitted, the allowed_html block defines what HTML is allowed. The context for this field is `event'. See the block description for allowed_html for details.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Property is a date</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This checkbox determines whether or not this event field is a date. Events are displayed on the calendar for these additional date fields as well as the start and end dates.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Display order</STRONG></DT>
<DD>What order to display this event field in, in relation to the other fields. If you enter an order number which is already in use, the conflicting number and all fields with order numbers higher than this are shifted down the page by one place.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Form field</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The block used to format the form field on the event submit/edit form. These are blocks whose names begin with <code>event_property_</code>. See the descriptions for the blocks for more information.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Validation regex</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A perl regular expression the value entered by the user is compared to. Pipes in the regular expression must be escaped. Leave this blank if you don't want to use a regex for validation.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>This property requires</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If this event field is used, the field named here must also be used. This is a good way to make a property `partially required'--for example, by default the `address' event field requires the `city' field, so even though neither of them are marked as required by the checkbox above, if an address is entered, a city must also be entered.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Description</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The event field description shown on the event submit/edit form. For when the title alone isn't descriptive enough.
</DD>
</DL>

</H3>

<P>
The Edit Calendar form has four pages: Edit Calendar Settings, Approve Submitted Events, Event List, and Invitation List.

<P>
The `Edit Calendar Settings' page is available to admins with the <B>edit_calendars</B> perm (<A HREF="A_12_Groups.html#perm-edit-calendars">A.12.15</A>) for any calendar, and to users with the <B>edit_own_calendar</B> perm (<A HREF="A_12_Groups.html#perm-edit-own-calendar">A.12.22</A>) for their calendar only. There are only four fields: a title, a description, and two permissions fields.

<P>
The `Approve Submitted Events' page contains a list of events which have been submitted and are pending approval by the calendar owner or site admin. The calendar owner can select several items by marking their checkboxes, then approving (Approve for display) or rejecting (Do not display) that group of events by choosing the appropriate radio button and clicking `Moderate'.

<P>
The `Event List' page is a four-column list which summarizes all events attached to the current calendar. The first column contains the event title, linked to the event; the second column contains the nickname of the user who submitted the event, the third column contains the event date, and the fourth column contains action links (such as `edit') depending on what permissions the current user has.

<P>
The `Invitation List' page lets you specify who may see or submit events to your calendar, if you have set either of the two calendar permission settings to `Only people on the invitation list'. Users are added one at a time by nickname, and can be removed via a `remove' link after their name once they are in the invitation list.
