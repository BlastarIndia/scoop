<P>
If you need help with anything Scoop-related, the first place you want to look is in this document.  After that, you can take a look at section&nbsp;<A HREF="C_Frequently_Asked.html#faq">C</A> for the FAQ and past problem descriptions to see if your question is answered there.  There's also the scoop-help and scoop-dev mailing lists; the first is for users and general questions about Scoop, and the second is for developers to discuss new features.

<P>
You can subscribe at <A HREF="http://lists.kuro5hin.org/mailman/listinfo/scoop-help">http://lists.kuro5hin.org/mailman/listinfo/scoop-help</A> or <A HREF="http://lists.kuro5hin.org/mailman/listinfo/scoop-dev">http://lists.kuro5hin.org/mailman/listinfo/scoop-dev</A> and read the archives at <A HREF="http://lists.kuro5hin.org/pipermail/scoop-help/">http://lists.kuro5hin.org/pipermail/scoop-help/</A> or <A HREF="http://lists.kuro5hin.org/pipermail/scoop-dev">http://lists.kuro5hin.org/pipermail/scoop-dev</A> to see if your question has already been asked and answered.

<P>
Actually, if you run Scoop it's a good idea to subscribe to scoop-help even if you don't have a problem, because then you get announcements about updates to scoop and how to use them.  It's a very low traffic list.

<P>
If you've searched all of the above and still can't figure it out, you can go to the slashnet IRC server (irc.slashnet.org) and join channel #scoop to talk to the developers.  If you do, you may have to be patient; many of the developers idle there all the time, and sometimes forget to indicate that they're away.  If you ask a question then stick around, someone will eventually look at their chat window and realize there's a question waiting to be answered.

<P>
